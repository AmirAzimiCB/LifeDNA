        Purpose of the LifeDNA Application
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        LifeDNA was founded to help people live better lives through the power
        in their DNA.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        To that end, LifeDNA provides the LifeDNA Application, which features
        personalized information and a number of LifeDNA Products that can give
        you insights about yourself based on your genetics. Some of them also
        offer you services based on those insights. There are many types of
        LifeDNA Products on the LifeDNA Application. Each type can give you
        certain kinds of insights.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        You can use the LifeDNA Application to read personalized information or
        browse and buy LifeDNA Products. Over time, new LifeDNA Products will be
        added to the LifeDNA Application. You can buy as many (or as few) of
        these products as you want. Before you buy a product, you’ll be informed
        what you can expect to learn from it. You’ll also learn what information
        we will use to create it.

      <Text variant="terms">
        LifeDNA may use your Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information as
        part of a pooled data set. We call these data sets “Aggregated Genetic
        Information.” This kind of data set combines de-identified data from
        many LifeDNA Users. These data sets would not include any details that
        make it easy to identify you. LifeDNA may use these data sets for
        business or promotional purposes. To use the LifeDNA Application, you
        must let LifeDNA use your information as part of these data sets.

      <Text variant="terms">
        LifeDNA strives to give you current, reliable, and high-quality
        experiences. As such, a key way that we will use Aggregated Genetic
        Information is to improve the LifeDNA Application. We may do so with our
        quality control methods. Some of them may focus on how we store and
        process your Genetic Information. Some of them may focus on how you use
        the LifeDNA Application. All information used for quality control will
        be used only within LifeDNA.

        found in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you close your
        LifeDNA Account, neither you nor we can access your information on
        LifeDNA moving forward. Closing your LifeDNA Account prevents you from
        buying any more LifeDNA Products and removes access to your LifeDNA
        Products.

        Risks
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        There are some risks that come with using the LifeDNA Application.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        There is a chance, you could learn something about yourself that you
        didn’t want to know. For instance, you could find out something that
        concerns you about your health. Since you share DNA with your blood
        relatives, these learnings could also affect them. You may want to
        discuss your options with your doctor, a mental health professional, or
        a genetic counselor before or after you get your LifeDNA Products.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        Under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, (GINA), no employer
        with at least fifteen workers can ask for your Genetic Information.
        Neither can any health insurer. However this does not apply to other
        groups, such as the US military or companies that offer life, long-term
        care, or disability insurance. Some states have safeguards for those
        types of insurance. You should be aware of the laws in your state and be
        careful with whom you choose to share your Genetic Information.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        There is a risk of a security event in which someone may access your
        data without your consent. These data could include your name, contact
        details, or Genetic Information. When combined, these data could allow
        someone to connect your Genetic Information back to you. LifeDNA takes
        active steps to reduce the risk of such an event. Please see our Privacy
        Policy for more details.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        LifeDNA may need to share details about you with regulators and law
        enforcement. These details may include your Genetic Information. We will
        only share these details if we are compelled by law to do so. Please see
        our Privacy Policy for more details.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        Lastly, each LifeDNA Product has its own risks, benefits, and
        limitations. The LifeDNA Application will give you some details about
        each LifeDNA Product. You should carefully weigh the risks, benefits,
        and limitations of each product you choose to buy. You may want to talk
        with a genetic counselor.

      <Text variant="terms" className="italic">
        Limitations
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        The LifeDNA Application has some limitations. Some of these are unique
        to LifeDNA. Some are related to genetic interpretation in general. Many
        of these are also discussed in our Terms of Service.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        LifeDNA only stores your genotype file. Some of the DNA that your
        genotype file does not contain could be needed for certain insights.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        Your Genetic Information cannot tell you everything about yourself. Your
        genes are only a part of who you are. Your lifestyle and habits make up
        a large part of who you are beyond your genetics.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        Most traits that your LifeDNA Products describe are not deterministic.
        In other words, your results describe your chance of having a given
        trait, but they can only rarely predict whether you do for certain. In
        some cases, factors like where and how you live can influence this
        chance more than your DNA.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        Your LifeDNA Products are based on the current state of knowledge. Over
        time, more will be known about DNA and how it affects traits. As this
        knowledge improves, we may update your LifeDNA results.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        The LifeDNA Products do not necessarily include all possible risk
        variants or genetic variants for the genes analyzed.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        Though not likely, your Genetic Information stored by LifeDNA could have
        some errors. In some cases, errors can occur while sequencing your DNA
        prior to uploading your genetic file onto our platform, or when we read
        the uploaded Genetic Information. LifeDNA has many quality control steps
        in place to find errors when they occur.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        In some cases, we may not be able to read your genetic file for
        technical reasons, such as not having the SNPs we read to provide you
        with LifeDNA Products.

        Honolulu, Hawaii before one arbitrator.
      </Text>
      <Text variant="terms">
        The parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in
        accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
        Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect. Except as otherwise
        provided herein, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the
        Federal Judicial Circuit in which LifeDNA’s principle place of business
        is located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten
        (10) calendar days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party,
        the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with at least five years’
        experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience with
        the subject matter of the dispute. If the parties do not agree on an
        arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, a party may petition the AAA
        to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience
        requirement. In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the
        enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in
        accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). The parties also
        agree that the AAA’s rules governing Emergency Measures of Protection

        The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party
        shall have rights of appeal except for those provided in section 10 of

        arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the
        arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to pay all or any
        portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties

        member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. Except as
        may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may disclose
        the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without the prior
        written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal
        right. If any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or
        unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or
        unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
        Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
        any other jurisdiction. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court
        rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury
        trial. This arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation or
        termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.

        <strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> You warrant and represent to Us that you
        have all necessary rights, power, and authority to agree to these Terms
        and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in this
        Agreement or in the performance of such obligations will place you in
        breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of either party
        to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be
        deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of
        this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
        will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that
        this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
        enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of the
        Program shall be subject to this Agreement unless explicitly stated
        otherwise in writing. We reserve the right to change this Agreement from
        time to time. Any updates to this Agreement shall be communicated to
        you. You acknowledge your responsibility to review this Agreement from
        time to time and to be aware of any such changes. By continuing to
        participate in the Program after any such changes, you accept this
        Agreement, as modified.
