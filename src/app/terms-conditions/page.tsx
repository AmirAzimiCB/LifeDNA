        part of a pooled data set. We call these data sets “Aggregated Genetic
        Information.” This kind of data set combines de-identified data from
        many LifeDNA Users. These data sets would not include any details that
        make it easy to identify you. LifeDNA may use these data sets for
        business or promotional purposes. To use the LifeDNA Application, you
        must let LifeDNA use your information as part of these data sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        LifeDNA strives to give you current, reliable, and high-quality
        experiences. As such, a key way that we will use Aggregated Genetic
        Information is to improve the LifeDNA Application. We may do so with our
        quality control methods. Some of them may focus on how we store and
        process your Genetic Information. Some of them may focus on how you use
        the LifeDNA Application. All information used for quality control will
        be used only within LifeDNA.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find more details about how we use Aggregated Genetic
        Information in our Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h2>Closing your LifeDNA Account</h2>
      <p>
        You can stop using the LifeDNA Application at any time. You can also
        choose to close your LifeDNA Account. More details about this can be
        found in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you close your
        LifeDNA Account, neither you nor we can access your information on
        LifeDNA moving forward. Closing your LifeDNA Account prevents you from
        buying any more LifeDNA Products and removes access to your LifeDNA
        Products.
      </p>
      <p>
        We cannot restore your account if you close it. If you wish to buy new
        LifeDNA Products or access the LifeDNA Application, you will need to
        create a new LifeDNA Account. To do so, you will also need to upload
        your genetic file again. When you close your account, we will archive
        your information. We will keep it archived for as long as we must to
        meet our legal and regulatory requirements.
      </p>
      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        We intend for you to benefit from the LifeDNA Application. You can do so
        by learning about yourself from your genetic file. What you learn may be
        useful for you in a number of ways. You might assuage your curiosity or
        simply enjoy learning about your genetics. You may also be able to apply
        what you learn to your health, wellness, family planning, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        How you benefit may change as your interests, needs, and motivations
        change through your life. How you benefit may also change as new LifeDNA
        Products are added to the LifeDNA Application. You may benefit in ways
        that we can’t predict today.
      </p>
      <h2>Risks</h2>
      <p>There are some risks that come with using the LifeDNA Application.</p>
      <p>
        There is a chance, you could learn something about yourself that you
        didn’t want to know. For instance, you could find out something that
        concerns you about your health. Since you share DNA with your blood
        relatives, these learnings could also affect them. You may want to
        discuss your options with your doctor, a mental health professional, or
        a genetic counselor before or after you get your LifeDNA Products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, (GINA), no employer
        with at least fifteen workers can ask for your Genetic Information.
        Neither can any health insurer. However this does not apply to other
        groups, such as the US military or companies that offer life, long-term
        care, or disability insurance. Some states have safeguards for those
        types of insurance. You should be aware of the laws in your state and be
        careful with whom you choose to share your Genetic Information.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a risk of a security event in which someone may access your
        data without your consent. These data could include your name, contact
        details, or Genetic Information. When combined, these data could allow
        someone to connect your Genetic Information back to you. LifeDNA takes
        active steps to reduce the risk of such an event. Please see our Privacy
        Policy for more details.
      </p>
      <p>
        LifeDNA may need to share details about you with regulators and law
        enforcement. These details may include your Genetic Information. We will
        only share these details if we are compelled by law to do so. Please see
        our Privacy Policy for more details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, each LifeDNA Product has its own risks, benefits, and
        limitations. The LifeDNA Application will give you some details about
        each LifeDNA Product. You should carefully weigh the risks, benefits,
        and limitations of each product you choose to buy. You may want to talk
        with a genetic counselor.
      </p>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        The LifeDNA Application has some limitations. Some of these are unique
        to LifeDNA. Some are related to genetic interpretation in general. Many
        of these are also discussed in our Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        LifeDNA only stores your genotype file. Some of the DNA that your
        genotype file does not contain could be needed for certain insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Genetic Information cannot tell you everything about yourself. Your
        genes are only a part of who you are. Your lifestyle and habits make up
        a large part of who you are beyond your genetics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most traits that your LifeDNA Products describe are not deterministic.
        In other words, your results describe your chance of having a given
        trait, but they can only rarely predict whether you do for certain. In
        some cases, factors like where and how you live can influence this
        chance more than your DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your LifeDNA Products are based on the current state of knowledge. Over
        time, more will be known about DNA and how it affects traits. As this
        knowledge improves, we may update your LifeDNA results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The LifeDNA Products do not necessarily include all possible risk
        variants or genetic variants for the genes analyzed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though not likely, your Genetic Information stored by LifeDNA could have
        some errors. In some cases, errors can occur while sequencing your DNA
        prior to uploading your genetic file onto our platform, or when we read
        the uploaded Genetic Information. LifeDNA has many quality control steps
        in place to find errors when they occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, we may not be able to read your genetic file for
        technical reasons, such as not having the SNPs we read to provide you
        with LifeDNA Products.
      </p>

        consent is not required to make any purchase from Us. While you consent

        are sent using an automatic telephone dialing system (“ATDS” or
        “autodialer”). Message and data rates may apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        User Opt Out: If you do not wish to continue participating in the

        Duty to Notify and Indemnify: If at any time you intend to stop using
        the mobile telephone number that has been used to subscribe to the
        Program, including canceling your service plan or selling or
        transferring the phone number to another party, you agree that you will
        complete the User Opt Out process set forth above prior to ending your
        use of the mobile telephone number. You understand and agree that your
        agreement to do so is a material part of these terms and conditions. You
        further agree that, if you discontinue the use of your mobile telephone
        number without notifying Us of such change, you agree that you will be
        responsible for all costs (including attorneys’ fees) and liabilities
        incurred by Us, or any party that assists in the delivery of the mobile
        messages, as a result of claims brought by individual(s) who are later
        assigned that mobile telephone number. This duty and agreement shall
        survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate
        in any of our Programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        YOU AGREE THAT YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD US HARMLESS FROM
