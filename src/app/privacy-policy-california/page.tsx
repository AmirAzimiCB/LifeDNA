      <Text variant="paragraph">
        This Privacy Notice for California Residents contains information
        required by the California Privacy Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as
        amended or replaced from time to time, along with any implementing
        regulations, and supplements our Privacy Policy. LifeDNA’s privacy
        principles are the same for all customers. For example, all customers
        can request a copy of their data, request deletion, and control their
        privacy settings in their Account Settings. This notice makes sure we
        cover California-specific requirements. In the event of any conflict
        between the terms of this notice and the Privacy Policy, the terms of
        this notice prevail.

        Your Rights

      <Text variant="paragraph">
        When we talk about “Personal Information” in this notice, we mean any
        information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being
        associated with you, or could reasonably be linked, directly or
        indirectly, with you, and as otherwise defined in the CCPA. The CCPA
        does not consider publicly available information as “Personal
        Information.”
      </Text>
      <Text variant="paragraph">
        Let’s start with your rights first. You have the right to:
      </Text>
      <ul className="list-disc text-sm font-normal flex flex-col gap-6 mb-6">
        <li className="ml-6 lg:ml-8">

        If you would like to make a CCPA rights request, you can email us at
        privacy@LifeDNA.com with the subject line “CCPA Rights Request”. We will
        require some additional information to verify your identity in order to
        process your request. Alternatively, you may exercise your CCPA rights
        through an authorized agent. If you use an authorized agent, we will
        require you to verify your identity and confirm that you have provided
        the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf. We
        will respond to your request within 45 days, and in more difficult cases
        we may extend our response time by another 45 days. The easiest way to
        exercise your rights is through your Account Settings so we can quickly
        verify your identity. Your rights under the CCPA are not absolute and
        LifeDNA may exercise limitations or exemptions as permitted by the CCPA.

      <Text variant="paragraph">
        LifeDNA does not sell Personal Information to third parties. The CCPA

        What We Collect
      </Text>
      <Text variant="paragraph">
        As detailed in our Privacy Policy, we collect Personal Information for
        various purposes with privacy principles in mind. Choice and
        transparency are just as important to us as they are to you. The
        categories of Personal Information and other terms used below are
        defined in California Civil Code 1798.140, and may include reference to
        certain key definitions set forth in our Privacy Policy. Some of the
        categories below require separate opt-in consent and these categories do
        not necessarily reflect all of the types of information that we may
        collect about you. We will provide you a separate notice if we collect
        any additional Personal Information from you!
      </Text>
      <Text variant="paragraph">
        In the last twelve (12) months, we have collected the following
