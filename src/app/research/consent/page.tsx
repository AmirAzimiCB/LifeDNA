        <li>
          The primary objective of LifeDNA Research is to create new discoveries
          about genetics and other variables that contribute to health and
          wellness.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you agree to this consent document, you are giving LifeDNA
          researchers permission to use some information (such as your genetic
          information and replies to research questionnaires) to investigate a
          wide range of research areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          LifeDNA conducts research with data that{" "}
          <strong>does not contain your name and contact information</strong> to
          ensure your privacy. This is aggregated with similar data from a
          significant number of research participants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain LifeDNA studies might be made{" "}
          <strong>in conjunction with third parties</strong>. These include
          academic institutions, pharmaceutical firms, or non-profit
          organizations. We may release analyses of research findings with
          qualified research collaborators and in scientific publications that
          do not recognize any specific individual.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even though you are unlikely to benefit directly from your
          involvement, you and other individuals may benefit in the future from
          breakthroughs that lead to innovations in healthcare or advancements
          to LifeDNA’s personalized products or services.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the event of a privacy breach, there is{" "}
          <strong>a very small chance</strong> that someone could gain access to
          your personal information (data that can be used to identify you)
          without your consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Participating in this study is <strong>completely optional</strong>,
          and you can change your mind at any time without compromising your
          access to LifeDNA’s reports and other services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="font-semibold">Why is LifeDNA conducting research?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        LifeDNA’s goal is to create and promote scientific discoveries about
        genetics and personalized wellness. To accomplish so, we pursue our own
        research while also cooperating and publishing our findings in genetic
        studies and journals to complement the work of other researchers
        throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Our findings could be utilized to develop novel techniques to improve
        people’s lives, as well as additional reports and features for the
        LifeDNA product and services. We look into:
      </p>
      <ul className="flex flex-col mb-6 gap-6 list-disc ml-6 lg:ml-8 text-lg">
        <li>Personal traits and characteristics</li>
        <li>People’s response to their genes</li>
        <li>Ancestry and its association with certain traits</li>
        <li>Lifestyle and personal habits</li>
        <li>Disease risks</li>
        <li>Diet, sleep, and physical activity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Simple characteristics like age, weight and physical measures, as well
        as alcohol intake and smoking behavior, are also discussed.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        LifeDNA generates insights by looking for trends in data from a large
        number of research participants. These patterns could reveal whether
        people with a specific set of genetic variables are more likely to
        develop certain traits. Another pattern could indicate a novel approach
        to treating a condition. Our findings could aid in the development of
        new medications and personalized treatments. Some of LifeDNA’s findings
        may aid researchers in better understanding certain diseases and other
        health conditions and may help in diagnosis and treatment options.

      <h2 className="font-semibold">
        What does taking part in LifeDNA Research entail?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        You will be asked to complete surveys or submit information about
        yourself to the LifeDNA website if you opt to participate in LifeDNA
        Research. You get to choose which surveys you want to complete, what
        information you want to contribute, and what questions you want to
        respond to. Giving consent indicates that you agree to allow LifeDNA
        researchers to use your Genetic and Self-reported information (including
        info given before consenting) for LifeDNA Research as mentioned above.
        The term “Genetic & Self-Reported Information” applies to the following:
      </p>
      <ul className="flex flex-col mb-6 gap-6 list-disc ml-6 lg:ml-8 text-lg">
        <li>Your genetic information</li>
        <li>
          Anything you enter into LifeDNA Research surveys, questionnaires, and
          other LifeDNA personalized services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain LifeDNA studies may be sponsored by or carried out in
          partnership with third parties, such as academic institutions,
          non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical corporations, or, whose added
          knowledge and/or resources can assist LifeDNA in making significant
          discoveries.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the event that the research findings result in valuable items or
          inventions that may be manufactured or sold, you will not earn any
          financial rewards if your information contributed to an idea or
          product that benefited LifeDNA or any of its research colleagues.
        </li>
        <li>
          When LifeDNA conducts research on sensitive themes, you will be given
          additional information to help you decide whether or not you wish to
          participate.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may notify you of new surveys and research opportunities as they
          are added to LifeDNA Research. We may send you notifications in your
          account or email invites to keep you informed about new research
          possibilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may use the results of further investigation of your saliva sample
          in LifeDNA Research if you have chosen to have your saliva sample
          stored in our lab.

      <ul className="flex flex-col mb-6 gap-6 list-disc ml-6 lg:ml-8 text-lg">
        <li>
          Participating in LifeDNA Research will not provide you with any

          concerns.
        </li>
        <li>
          You, including those who share your health traits, may, however,
          benefit indirectly from LifeDNA Research findings in the future, such
          as those that improve LifeDNA reports, products, and other
          personalized services or contribute to illness prevention and
          treatment.
