      <h1>Data Security</h1>
      <p>
        LifeDNA is dedicated to providing the robust data privacy and security
        controls required for DNA testing and DNA analysis.
      </p>
      <h2>What we do with your data and personal information</h2>
      <p>
        LifeDNA ensures transparency about the type of data we collect, the
        purposes for which we do so, and how we utilize it. Personal information
        is typically processed by LifeDNA for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>DNA kit purchase(s).</li>
        <li>Make an account, then add a kit to that account.</li>
        <li>Promote our reports and other DNA – personalized services.</li>
        <li>
          Conduct website maintenance, analytics, and network and infrastructure
          security.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Generally, we process highly sensitive personal data, such as genetic
        information, and other personal data in order to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Process your sample at the lab.</li>
        <li>Generate your reports.</li>
        <li>
          Maintain and improve the tools, features, and usability of your
          account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take part in the LifeDNA research if you’ve consented to participate.
        </li>
        <li>Address your concerns through our Support specialists.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Gaining access to, downloading, and deleting your data</h2>
      <p>
        At LifeDNA, we would like you to understand how we secure your personal
        information, why we store it, and to whom we disclose it.
      </p>
      <p>
        LifeDNA customers can ask for a copy of their data by contacting our
        Support Team at <a href="mailto:aloha@lifedna.com">aloha@lifedna.com</a>
        . You can request your data to be deleted at any time. Simply submit our
        request to our Support Team. Data deletion is irreversible and cannot be
        stopped, reversed, retracted, or undone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not disclose our users’ information to law authorities unless we
        are obliged to do so by a legal subpoena or court order. LifeDNA has
        never had a data breach in our system, and we regularly check our
        security measures in order to keep DNA information protected at all
        times.
      </p>
      <h2>Protecting your data</h2>
      <p>
        We put in place the proper organizational and technical mechanisms to
        provide a level of security corresponding with the risk involved in
        processing personal data. Your DNA and personal information are
        protected by well-renowned organizational and technical safeguards.
      </p>
      <p>
        These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access to your genetic
        information and to guarantee that it is used responsibly.
      </p>
      <h2>Managing our third-party service providers</h2>
      <p>
        The majority of data processing necessary to provide our
        DNA-personalized reports and insights is carried out directly by
        LifeDNA. However, we do work with a few outside service providers to
        help support our services, particularly in the following areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lab</li>
        <li>Courier (for DNA kit purchases)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each third-party service provider can guarantee the proper level of
        security and data protection thanks to our meticulous screening
        procedure. For more information, check out LifeDNA’s Privacy Policy.
